# Nimbus
Nimbus is a .NET client library to add an easy to develop against experience against the Azure Service Bus.

If you've used NServiceBus or MassTransit before, you'll be right at home.

Nimbus was designed to be lightweight and pluggable. You won't find fifty conflicting versions of other projects ILMerged into the binary. If you want to plug your own container or logging framework in, go right ahead. If you
want something that will just work out of the box we give you that, too.

Nimbus provides implementations of all of the common messaging patterns for building distributed, service-oriented systems.

## How to get started?

This site has step by step instructions for getting up and running with Nimbus as well as an explaination of Nimbus's messaging patterns and how to implement them. Follow the links on the left for a quick and easy guide to building applications with Nimbus.

If you want more code, clone the source and have a look at the [Sample Applications](https://github.com/NimbusAPI/Nimbus/tree/master/src/Samples).


## Can I contribute?
Absolutely! This is very very very early days for this project. We need things
like:

1.  More container implementations
1.  Logger implementations
1.  Samples
1.  Real world input from your projects
2.  Success stories and case studies

We've put some issues here marked as [Up-for-grabs][4] if you want to jump in.

Nimbus is brought to you by Andrew Harcourt [@uglybugger][1] and Damian Maclennan [@damianm][2].

You can follow Nimbus updates on the [NimbusAPI][3] Twitter account.
