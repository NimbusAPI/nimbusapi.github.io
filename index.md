# Nimbus
Nimbus is a .NET client library to add an easy to develop against experience against the Azure Service Bus or the Windows Service Bus.

If you've used NServiceBus or MassTransit before, you'll be right at home.

Nimbus was designed to be lightweight and pluggable. You won't find fifty conflicting versions of other projects ILMerged into the binary. If you want to plug your own container or logging framework in, go right ahead. If you
want something that will just work out of the box we give you that, too.

Nimbus provides implementations of all of the common messaging patterns for building distributed, service-oriented systems.
