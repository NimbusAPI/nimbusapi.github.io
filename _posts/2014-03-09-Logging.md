In any real world application you want some form of instrumentation. With Nimbus we've added logging hooks into the bus, but not tied it to any specific logging library.

This leaves you free to implement your own logging provider. We've got two already for you, a Console logger for development and thanks to [Nick Blumhardt](http://nblumhardt.com/) we also have a [Serilog](http://serilog.net/) implementation.

To get Serilog install the package via Nuget

	Install-Package Nimbus.Logger.Serilog

Then you can register the logger with your container and it will get passed to Nimbus.

	builder.RegisterType<SerilogStaticLogger>()
	       .AsImplementedInterfaces()
           .SingleInstance();

Of course you can register a console logger with your container if you really want to.

	builder.RegisterType<ConsoleLogger>()
       .AsImplementedInterfaces()
       .SingleInstance();
