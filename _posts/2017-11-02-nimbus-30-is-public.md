Yes, we agree. Holding off this long was silly. 

We (and a lot of others) have been running 3.0 in production for ages from the Myget feed. But a few bits of doco (mainly) were holding us back. We decided to push the button and push it live.

You can read the breaking changes (here)[/2016/04/24/nimbus-30-nearing-release/].

We do need help with documentation, community management, and code. That much is obvious. If you'd like to help, please get in touch on (Gitter)[https://gitter.im/NimbusAPI/Nimbus] or email damian@damianm.com and we can chat. We want Nimbus to be awesome, we want it to stick around, so we'd love to hear from you.
