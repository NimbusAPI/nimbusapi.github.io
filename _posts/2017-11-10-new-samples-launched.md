title: New sample apps launched

The Nimbus codebase had accumulated a number of small sample apps. Some had outdated ASP.NET dependencies, and none of them were consistent. As part of the 3.0 public release we deleted all the existing samples.

We've just added a sample app we used for a training workshop recently which gives a good demonstration of Nimbus features such as the Redis transport, Interceptors, Log Correlation, PubSub, and Commands.

You can get it [here](https://github.com/NimbusAPI/nimbus-samples-stackcafe).
